# Yoga Recommendation using Flask 
  Yoga Recommendation System according to the user's medical conditions using Python Flask

## Project Overview
Yoga is a 5000 years old psycho-spiritual technique that focuses on creating harmony between the mind and the body. The efficacy of Yoga has been proven for certain medical conditions.

There are more than 200 postures and pranayamas with specific benefits that constitute Yoga. One needs an able yoga teacher to identify the cause of suffering and decide postures and pranayamas. In the absence of such a teacher, the Internet is where one searches for information. A simple google search on keyword yoga asanas has over a billion results. It is a challenge to extract correct and reliable information. The information available on the websites is incomplete, unreliable and not verifiable.

In this project, we propose a machine learning-based yoga recommendation system that can recommend asanas based on the user's medical conditions.
